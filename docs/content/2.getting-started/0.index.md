# What is Una UI?

**Una UI** is an atomic UI Framework powered by the [UNOCSS](https://unocss.dev/){target="_blank"} engine. It provides components and presets for creating stunning user interfaces with ease.

## Motivation

Over the years, I've delved into numerous projects, consistently relying on UI frameworks for my application front-ends. My exploration encompassed options like [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/){target="_blank"}, [NaiveUI](https://naiveui.com/){target="_blank"}, and other similar frameworks, yet none truly met my expectations. Customization often proved cumbersome, given their rigid design, not to mention the bloated CSS bundles even when utilizing a handful of components.

Then emerged game-changers like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){target="_blank"}, [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/){target="_blank"} came along. These frameworks have indeed satisfied me, except there was a big thing missing: they don't have any built-in components that is easily customizable accross to all of my projects, which means everytime I start a new project, I have to build the same components over and over again, this drove me to create <b style="color: var(--c-brand-next)">Una UI</b>.

Una UI brings together the best of both worlds of UI frameworks and CSS frameworks offers more customization, more flexibility, more power without sacrificing css bundled size and performance whether in local development or production, small or large projects.

## Design Principles

Following UNOCSS design principles, being atomic is the core of Una UI. It means that the framework generates CSS only for used utilities, ensuring speed and efficiency in any project size.

For example, the `Una UI` provides different button variants, such as `solid`, `outline`, `link`, `soft` and more. A typical framework would generate CSS for all variants, even if you only use one for the entire project. Una UI, on the other hand, generates CSS only for the used variant even if multiple variants are configured.

Heres an example of button - vs. typical framework:

:::CodeGroup
  ::code-block{label="X UI"}
```vue
  <XButton variant="solid">
    Solid Button
  </XButton>
```
  ::
  ::code-block{label="UNA UI"}
```vue
  <NButton btn="solid">
    Solid Button
  </NButton>
```
  ::
  ::code-block{label="Preview" preview}
    <NButton btn="solid">Solid Button</NButton>
  ::
:::

> Unlike other frameworks Una UI get advantage of UNOCSS [shortcuts](https://unocss.dev/config/shortcuts#shortcuts){target="_blank"} feature to generate CSS for the **solid variant** and used [attributify](https://unocss.dev/presets/attributify#attributify-mode){target="_blank"} feature to act as the `prop` to the component to make it more customizable while keeping it readable and clean. In short the `btn` prop is not just a prop but a utility class also, so `btn="solid"` is equivalent to `class="btn-solid"` in UNOCSS.

Heres another example of button with `variant`, `color`, and `block` vs. typical framework:

:::CodeGroup
  ::code-block{label="X UI"}
```vue
  <XButton variant="solid" color="orange" block>
    Solid Button
  </XButton>
```
  ::  
  ::code-block{label="UNA UI"}
```vue
  <NButton btn="solid-orange block">
    Solid Button
  </NButton>
```
  ::
  ::code-block{label="Preview" preview}
    <NButton btn="solid-orange block">Solid Button</NButton>
  ::
:::

> Notice we used `orange` color, but most frameworks offers limited colors like `secondary`, `accent`, `danger`, and other fix colors across the projects so you have to configure it your own. However, Una UI provides all [tailwindcss colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors){target="_blank"} with auto dark mode support. And yes we do not need other colors but the thing is, a typical framework generates CSS for all colors even if you only use one color across the project, while Una UI generates CSS only for the used color but still offers all colors.

> Notice the simplicity of adding options like `block` in Una UI compared to other framework that requires additional attributes, and note that `block` css is only generated if you used it, the same goes for other utilities and options.
